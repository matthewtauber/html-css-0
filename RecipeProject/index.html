        <h2>Pizza origin:</h2>
            <p>Pizza dates back thousands of years, believe it or not, tracing its roots back to the flatbreads with toppings that were popular with ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. But modern pizza, the flatbreads with tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings, was born along the western coast of Italy, in the city of Naples.</p>   
            <p>Many people have different opinions on the best slice of pizza. I personally love a New York slice or a Sicilian slice. A New York slice is thin and crispy, and has a sweet tomato sauce. The Sicilian slice has a thick crust and a more mellow sauce, as well as a bunch of cheese. I recomend both, you can get both at Sal's Pizzeria in Mamaroneck New York.</p>
