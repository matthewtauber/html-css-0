            <h1>My top 5 favorite movies of all time:</h1>
            <p>Most of my favorite movies make you rethink how you look at things. That is how I determine if the movie is good. Other movies just deliver a great plot and do this with great pacing.</p>

        <h2>Inception</h2>
        <p>Inception is one of my personal favorite movies. This movie had me questioning what was real and not.<br> The movie a great plot and amazing pacing. This was expected because the movie was created by the <br>great Christopher Nolan. I give this movie a 9.2/10.</p>

        <h2>Ford vs. Ferarri</h2>
        <p>Ford vs. Ferrari does not make you question your life. It doesn't keep you on your toes. But it pulls you<br> into the story of two friends who embark on a journey to win. Ford vs. Ferrari is based on a true<br> story and really shows this story perfectly. With some of the most famous actors of all time, this movie is amazing. I rate it a 8.9/10.</p>

        <p>American Psycho, like the other movies on this list, makes you question life. Christian Bale put his life<br> into this movie and did a magnificent job. The movie is very dark but has an amazing plot and the<br> pacing is amazing. I love this movie and I rate it a 8.6/10.</p>
