                <b>A Review of HTML</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">" charecters.<br />
                The best part about HTML, is that once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can lool up how to use all of the others!

            Links are very useful, and hekp users to quickly navigate new pages, both within and outside of the current website.
            <br />
            For instence, they can quickly direct users to <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google's Homepage</a>.
            <br />
            <a href="mailto:mtauber@student.mamkschools.org">Emails</a>, can also be easily sent through the use of links.

        <p> Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value "left" is a perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of the text by replacing the "align" attribute with "right". </p>
